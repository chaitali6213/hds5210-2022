# Week 03 Feedback

In 14.3, 14.4, and 14.5, you are overwriting the value of the input parameters, making them unusable anywhere else in the function and making the code a bit confusing.

In 14.4, you rewrite all the same code again instead of just calling your LACE() function.

I deducted 2 points for these style considerations.
